## BlackJack Project - Week 4 Skill Distillery

### Overview

The project BlackJack is designed to:

- Allow a user to play the card game BlackJack against a Dealer.
- After starting the program, the user is asked for his or her name and is brought to a menu to select the option to play BlackJack. During gameplay, the user will have the option to be dealt a new card or stay with the hand they currently possess. The player that holds the highest value hand without going over 21 wins.
- The user can play as many games as they want due to the infinite loop menu.

### Technologies Used

- Eclipse
- Java
- GitHub/Git

### Lessons Learned
- This project had strong elements of inheritance throughout, which made it easy to see the advantages it has in building programs. The base classes of this program can be extended and modified to suit a range of card games.
- In developing class structure, it is important to focus on IS-A and HAS-A connections when establishing which classes should extend other classes.
- Refactoring multiple nested if statements into code that looks better comes with the downside of making it less easy to read, generally. I've heard somewhere that code is read more often than written. This project was the first project I considered refactoring solely for the sake of aesthetics, and I decided against it. As I was troubleshooting bugs in the program, I found the nested if statements were easy to go through to locate issues with gameplay logic.
